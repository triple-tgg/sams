# Services Step Refactoring

## Overview
Successfully refactored the Services.step.tsx component from a monolithic 899-line file into a modular, organized structure following the same pattern used for the Flight step.

## New Structure

### `/ServicesStep/` Directory
- **`index.tsx`** - Main component (177 lines, down from 899)
- **`types.ts`** - Type definitions, interfaces, and constants
- **`schema.ts`** - Zod validation schema with comprehensive validation rules
- **`utils.ts`** - Utility functions and data transformation
- **`useServicesSubmission.ts`** - Custom hook for form submission and array operations
- **`FormSections.tsx`** - Reusable form section components (Aircraft Checks, Defects, Personnel)
- **`FluidSection.tsx`** - Fluid and operational sections components

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Modular Architecture**
- Separated concerns into dedicated files
- Improved code readability and maintainability
- Easier testing and debugging

### 2. **Enhanced Form Validation**
- Comprehensive Zod schema with conditional validation
- Proper TypeScript type safety
- Custom validation rules for business logic

### 3. **Reusable Components**
- Form sections can be reused across different forms
- Consistent UI patterns and behavior
- Easier to extend and modify

### 4. **Custom Hooks**
- Centralized form submission logic
- Reusable array manipulation functions
- Better separation of concerns

### 5. **Type Safety**
- Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
- Proper type definitions for all form data
- Enhanced developer experience

## Migration Details

### Before:
- Single 899-line file
- Mixed concerns and responsibilities
- Difficult to maintain and test
- Limited reusability

### After:
- 7 modular files with clear responsibilities
- Main component reduced to 177 lines
- Improved code organization
- Enhanced maintainability

## Components Breakdown

### AircraftChecksSection
- Dynamic aircraft check forms
- Maintenance type and sub-type selection
- LAE and Mechanic hours tracking

### AdditionalDefectsSection
- Conditional defect rectification forms
- File upload for defect photos
- ATA chapter tracking

### FluidSection
- Fluid type selection
- Engine oil sets management
- Hydraulic oil tracking

### PersonnelSection
- Staff assignment and scheduling
- Time tracking
- Personnel type classification

### OperationalSections
- Flight deck operations
- Aircraft towing operations
- Time and date tracking

## Benefits

1. **Maintainability**: Easier to find and modify specific functionality
2. **Reusability**: Components can be used in other forms
3. **Testing**: Individual components can be tested in isolation
4. **Performance**: Better code splitting and lazy loading potential
5. **Developer Experience**: Clear structure makes onboarding easier

## Usage

```tsx
import ServicesStep from './ServicesStep'

// Basic usage
<ServicesStep 
  flightNumber={flightNumber}
  onNextStep={handleNextStep}
  initialData={existingData}
/>
```

The refactored component maintains full compatibility with the existing implementation while providing significant improvements in code organization and maintainability.
